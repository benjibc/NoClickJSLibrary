NoClickJSLibrary
================
The intention of this library is turning any website into a website that
requires no clicking to go around. This will be a small project of my own that
will not be updated very frequently.

The library is under development right now, therefore please be patient before
you file any complaints about the speed of the development.

Please file any bug report at Github, so people can deal with it collectively.

If you are interested in talking part in this project, please contact me at
leorex@ucla.edu
